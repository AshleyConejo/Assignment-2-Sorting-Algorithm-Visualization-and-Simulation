-Merge Sort Algorithm with Sound Effects-

This project implements the Merge Sort algorithm with added sound effects for each significant step in the process. The algorithm splits an array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges them back together while playing a sound effect at each step.

Prerequisites:
-Before running the code, ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed. You can install them using pip:
pip install playsound

Notes:
1. The sound file "DING Sound Effects.mp3" should be located in a folder named Sound 3 in the same directory as the script.
2. Ensure your system supports audio playback for the playsound library to work correctly.
3. The script runs in a loop, prompting the user for the array size. To stop the script, you can manually interrupt it (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal).
